- I think paint.ts example could be rewritten to only use set & text 8 bit variants
- maybe give input callback api?
  - onInput(f) -> does process.stdin.on('data', f)
- add example/paint to readme w/ sceen capture gif
- unit tests
  - color input number bounds
- review if any color names should be added
- publish to npm
- Finish names for box drowing characters
